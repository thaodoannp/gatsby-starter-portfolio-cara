# Project of 1000 Electric Beds
## Hillrom Medical Bed
<p>

<br/> Time: 2020
<br/> Venue: HCMC Oncology hospital - Branch 2 - Vietnam
<br/> Person in charge: Thao Doan & Project team
<br/> Description: This project had prolonged about 5 years to complete. There was enormous coordination across functional teams and stakeholders, including marketing, sales, tender, project, logistics, and board of directors from the company, Oncology hospital, government, and Hill-rom. I was proud to be a core team member to deal with price negotiation, configuration preparation for tender submission, product placement and training. The new campus would feature 1,000 beds divided into one-bed and three-bed wards instead of multi-bed rooms like the old campus. It is one of two hospitals in Saigon with a helipad.
